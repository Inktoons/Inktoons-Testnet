# Inktoons Early Access Economy

This document defines the rules for the Early Access (Monetization) system using Inks.

## The Core Concept
Creators can choose to monetize specific chapters. This creates a "Fast Pass" or "Early Access" model.

## Rules
1.  **Lock Period:** 4 Days.
    *   From the moment of upload, the chapter is locked for free users.
    *   After 96 hours, it automatically unlocks.
2.  **Currency:** "Inks".
3.  **Pricing (The Ratio):**
    *   **Standard Chapter Cost:** 50 Inks.
    *   *Rationale:* This is a micro-transaction friendly amount that allows users to unlock multiple chapters with a small purchase or ad-watch reward.

## User Flow
1.  **Creator:** Uploads chapter -> Toggles "Monetize" -> System auto-calculates Free Release Date -> Creator Confirms.
2.  **Reader (Free):** Sees "Locked" icon -> Must wait 4 days.
3.  **Reader (Paid):** Splits 50 Inks -> Unlocks immediately -> Access forever.

## Future Pi Network Integration
*   Users will buy Inks using Pi.
*   Ratio: TBD (e.g., 1 Pi = 100 Inks).
